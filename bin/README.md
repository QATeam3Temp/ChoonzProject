# Choonz-Starter

Starter code for SDET final project specification - music website "Choonz"

## Concept

This code is designed as a starting point for the final project specification for SDET.

This should be scaleable from 3 to 5+ entities:

- **MUST HAVE** - Track, Artist, Album
- **COULD HAVE** - Genre, Playlist
- Others TBD

## Specifications

The current idea as of 23-Sep-2020 is to release iterative specifications for this project, with varying degrees of functionality which the client/PO will want.

These are TBD for now, but will be included here within a `_documentation` folder in due course.
